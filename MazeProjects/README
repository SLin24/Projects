For this project to work on your own local system, there are two file paths that need to be changed.
Inside MazeSolver.py, there needs to be a change for the file path to chromedriver on line 26
The second change is to insert the path to your download folder which would be on line 39
As for the rest, simply having the libraries will be sufficient to run the code


HOW DOES THE PROGRAM WORK AFTER RUNNING?

1. Copy Paste (Ctr+C) the entirety of the Maze.js File
2. Once the webpage loads, it will automatically open the inspect element window
3. Simply click on console. Choose the mode you would like the program to solve on the website on the left (Anything except Roads Mode)
4. After selecting the mode, make sure to not disrupt the position of the player, and simply paste the Maze.js code into the console
5. After pasting and entering, simply close out of the inspect element window, and the player should start moving within 3~4 seconds
6. After the player finishes, the window will automatically close within ~2 seconds
7. Afterwards, the program will delete the downloaded CSV file. 
8. If you close out of the program too early, you may have to manually delete the CSV file from downloads.
